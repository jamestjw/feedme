# feedme

Simple tool to create an RSS feed from an instagram profile. 

## Usage
Suppose that we want an RSS feed of McDonald's instagram handle @mcdonalds, we just have to do the following
``` bash
./feedme -t mcdonalds
```

## Potential improvements

Make it possible to host this tool as a web application so that the feeds can be accessed like typical RSS feeds.
